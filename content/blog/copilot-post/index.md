## What is this post?

I used [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to write everything. All I
did myself (being a human) was write a couple words and let it finish it off.
I'll put any text that I wrote myself in an "aside" box, like you can see on
this paragraph.

Copilot is a [Cloud Native
Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). It's used for
managing the lifecycle of your application. It's also used as a tool for
creating and managing Copilot projects.

## What is this?

This is an article about [GitHub Copilot]() and the Copilot CLI. It's a tool for
creating and managing Copilot projects. I wrote it to help me learn the [GitHub
Copilot API]() and to learn how to use the CLI. You can read more about the API
[here](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/). Next time you want to learn

## Code blocks

{{< aside >}}
These next subsections are written by GitHub Copilot. All I did was write the
section headers, start the code block, and type some comments to get it started.
I have no idea if the code actually works (or even does anything at all), so
test it at your own risk!

### A random program

```js
var x = Math.random() * 10;

// do something with the coordinates
console.log(x, y, z);
```
